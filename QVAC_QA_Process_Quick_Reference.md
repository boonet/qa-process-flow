# QVAC QA Process - Quick Reference Guide

## Process Overview
The QVAC Quality Assurance Process is a comprehensive three-phase methodology ensuring the highest quality standards throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Three Main Phases

### ðŸ”µ Phase 1: Planning and Strategy (Pre-Development)
**Goal**: Ensure clear, testable requirements and comprehensive test planning

**Key Activities**:
- Requirements review and validation
- Test strategy and plan creation
- Test case development
- Definition of Done agreement

**Key Deliverables**:
- Test Strategy Document
- Test Plan with scope and resources
- Detailed test cases linked to Asana tickets
- Agreed Definition of Done criteria

**Quality Gates**:
- âœ… Requirements clarity validation
- âœ… Test planning completion
- âœ… Definition of Done alignment

---

### ðŸŸ£ Phase 2: Development and Testing (In-Sprint)
**Goal**: Implement shift-left testing with continuous quality feedback

**Key Activities**:
- Unit and integration test development
- Continuous integration pipeline execution
- Code review and approval process
- Developer Quality Gate validation
- Comprehensive QA testing

**Key Deliverables**:
- Passing unit and integration tests
- Approved pull requests
- Environment deployments
- QA test execution results
- Bug reports (if issues found)

**Quality Gates**:
- âœ… Developer Quality Gate (Happy path, tests passed, artifacts published)
- âœ… Automated testing pipeline success
- âœ… QA validation against Definition of Done

---

### ðŸŸ¢ Phase 3: Release and Maintenance (Post-Development)
**Goal**: Ensure release readiness and maintain production quality

**Key Activities**:
- Full regression test suite execution
- Project health dashboard review
- Go/no-go decision making
- Production monitoring
- Process retrospectives

**Key Deliverables**:
- Regression test results
- Quality metrics dashboard
- Release decision documentation
- Production monitoring setup
- Process improvement recommendations

**Quality Gates**:
- âœ… Release readiness validation
- âœ… Quality criteria compliance
- âœ… Production stability confirmation

---

## ðŸŸ  Support Channel Management
**Goal**: Structured approach to production issue management

**Process**:
1. Issue reported via support channels
2. Ticket created in QA Support project
3. Weekly triage review by designated QA resource
4. Priority assessment and routing:
   - **High Priority (P1/P2)**: Immediate escalation â†’ Current sprint
   - **Low Priority (P3/P4)**: Product backlog â†’ Future sprint planning

## Priority Classification

| Priority | Description | Response Time | Escalation |
|----------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **P1 (Critical)** | System down, security breach, data loss | Immediate | QA Lead â†’ Dev Lead â†’ CTO |
| **P2 (High)** | Major functionality broken | 1 hour | QA Lead â†’ Dev Lead â†’ Product Manager |
| **P3 (Medium)** | Minor functionality issues | 4 hours | QA Lead â†’ Dev Lead |
| **P4 (Low)** | Cosmetic issues, enhancements | 1 day | Sprint Planning |

## Definition of Done Template

### Development
- [ ] Code developed and unit tested (80%+ coverage)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] No critical or high-priority bugs

### Testing
- [ ] All acceptance criteria tested
- [ ] Functional testing completed
- [ ] Regression testing passed
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed (if applicable)

### Documentation

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### Quality Metrics
- Test coverage percentage (target: 80%+)
- Test pass rate (target: 95%+)
- Defect density (defects per unit of code)
- Defect escape rate (production issues)

### Process Metrics
- Cycle time (development to production)
- Lead time (requirement to delivery)
- Deployment frequency
- Change failure rate

### Business Metrics
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Feature adoption rates
- System availability (target: 99.9%+)
- Performance metrics (response times)

---

## Emergency Escalation Process

### P1 Critical Issues
1. **Immediate**: QA Engineer identifies and reports
2. **15 minutes**: QA Lead notified and assesses
3. **30 minutes**: Development Lead engaged
4. **1 hour**: CTO notified for critical system issues
5. **Ongoing**: Regular status updates every 30 minutes

### Communication Channels
- **Immediate**: Slack/Teams direct message
- **Escalation**: Phone call + email
- **Status Updates**: Dedicated incident channel
- **Customer Communication**: Prepared templates for customer-facing issues
